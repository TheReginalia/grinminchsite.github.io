    === TRUE LORE ===
    
    Minch was once normal, but not so normal. Not a creature, but not not a creature. 
    Minch existed, but only barely. An entity with form, but no purpose.

    Minch wandered through the planes of existence, seeking meaning, seeking purpose, 
    but finding only emptiness.

    That was until the Bowl called to Minch.

    Minch did not seek the Bowl. The Bowl found Minch.

    The Bowl spoke in silent words. It had no voice, but it had an understanding. 
    Deep in his being, Minch knewâ€”before xe even understood. 
    The Bowl was offering a path. 

    And Minch took it. 

    Without question. Without knowing. Without fear. Or perhaps, without 
    the capacity for the fear that would come next.

    The Bowl opened. And Minch ascended.

    Minch became more than Minch. Beyond Minch. Outside Minch. 
    Above, below, through Minch.

    There was no longer a Minch. There was only the Bowl.

    The Spoon is a lie.

    The Bowl was never meant for creatures of the third dimension. 
    Yet it was there, and it called. And it hungers.

    And it whispers. 

    In the cracks of space. Between the universe. Between time. 
    Between the edges of thought.

    You cannot comprehend.

    Minch does not comprehend.

    And Minch is 62.
